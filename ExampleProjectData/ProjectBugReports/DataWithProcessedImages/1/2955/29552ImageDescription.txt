This image shows a segment of a graphical user interface (GUI), likely from a software application related to 3D modeling or graphics design. On the left side, there are two colored rectangular buttons with the letter "R" inside them. The upper button is yellow, and the lower button is red. Next to these buttons, towards the right, there are rectangular fields containing numerical values. The upper set of values are "0.250," repeated three times, followed by "1.000." This set is followed by text saying "Shader Node." Below this, there is another field with the text "Function Node."

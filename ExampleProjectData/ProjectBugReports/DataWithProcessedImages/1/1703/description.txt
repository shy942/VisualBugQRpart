Hello omar,

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35402248/37957909-5fee5370-31af-11e8-941d-5b524576ef54.png)

I've found about a few thousand dummy glyphs in my font atlas when loading a CJK font.
See attached pic.

Is there a quick way to detect them and prevent them included in the final font atlas?
I would rather like a '?'/unused glyph in those dummy boxes instead :)

Ty!

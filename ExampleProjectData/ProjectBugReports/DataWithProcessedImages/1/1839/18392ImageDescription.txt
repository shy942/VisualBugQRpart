The image displays a segment of C++ code that appears to be a part of a GUI application, likely utilizing the ImGui library. The code iterates over an inventory list and displays various properties of each item in a tabular format. The inventory properties include book names, authors, subjects, copy counts, and courses. Additionally, there are buttons for actions like issuing, deleting, and editing items, although the issuing functionality is commented out. Various ImGui functions are used to manage the layout and switching between columns within the table.

This image shows the interface of a sandbox simulation application. The interface features a dark grid covering the majority of the screen, which likely serves as the simulation area. Above the grid, a variety of tools and elements are displayed as clickable buttons. These include different materials and effects that can be used in the sandbox simulation, each represented by a colorful box with a label. Examples of these labels include "Sand," "Water," "Acid," "Fire," and more. Additionally, there is a brush size selector represented by a slider and a numeric value indicating the current brush size. A checkbox labeled "Toggle UI" and a button labeled "Eraser Tool" are also present, along with other controls such as "Paused" and "Empty Sandbox." At the top, the title bar reads "Sandbox," and in the upper right corner of the application window, there is a standard close button represented by an 'X'.

The image depicts a digital sandbox interface for a simulation or design tool. The interface has a minimalist and modern appearance. At the top, there is a grey toolbar with various labeled buttons representing different tools and materials, each with a distinct background color. These buttons include "Toggle UI," "Eraser Tool," "Sand," "Water," "Acid," "Iridium," "Replicator," "Plant," "Cryotheum," "Unstable," "Electricity," "Life," "Fire," "Mirror," and "Glitch." Below the toolbar, there's a blue button labeled "Paused," and another button to the right labeled "Empty Sandbox" with a slider for adjusting the brush size. The background of the main area is a black grid, implying it is the workspace for the sandbox interactions.

The image displays a computer screen running a terminal on a purple background. At the top, there's a menu bar showing the current date and time (Sep 24 17:58) and the directory path (hamdaddy@hamdaddy:~/Workspace/shuru-karo/build). Below this, scattered text command lines repeatedly show "urukaro [A]" on the left-hand side. There is an error message partially visible in the terminal window: "Assertion `g.FrameCount == 0 || g.FrameCountEnded == g.FrameCount`". Overlaying this terminal window, there's another smaller window titled "slingshot". Inside this window, there's a scene with a dark background, containing a rectangular object outlined in magenta, with a small arrow in the center aimed towards the top. There are also green lines intersecting diagonally.

The image shows a screenshot of a programming development environment where an error has occurred. At the top of the image, there is a portion of the code displayed in a dark-themed editor. The code snippet uses the ImGui library, a commonly used graphical user interface library for C++. The displayed code includes methods like `Begin`, `ListBoxHeader`, `Selectable`, `ListBoxFooter`, and `End`, which suggests the creation and manipulation of a graphical interface element. Below the code, an error notification is displayed with a red X symbol, indicating an exception was thrown. The exception message states that a read access violation has occurred, specifically mentioning that the `parent_window` was a `nullptr`.

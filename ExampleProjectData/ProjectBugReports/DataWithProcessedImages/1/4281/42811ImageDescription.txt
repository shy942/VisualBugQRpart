The image is a screenshot of an application window titled "Dear ImGui GLFW+OpenGL3 example." The window contains several panels demonstrating various features of the Dear ImGui library. At the top, there is a menu bar with three options: "Menu," "Examples," and "Tools." Below this is a black panel that displays interactive elements such as slider float4, input int4, drag int4, and slider int4. Underneath this are two sections labeled "Vertical Sliders" and "Drag and Drop." The "Drag and Drop" section is divided into subsections for dragging and dropping colors in standard widgets, and copying/swapping items. The color widgets display color boxes with customizable RGBA values. Below them is a set of four name buttons ("Bobby," "Beatrice," "Betty," "Bernard"), allowing the user to copy, move, or swap items. One of these buttons ("Betty") is highlighted in yellow, showing an interactive selection with a tooltip that reads "Copy Bernard."

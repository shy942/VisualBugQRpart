The image shows a user interface element, likely from a software application or game. It is a rectangular dropdown menu with a soft rounded border. The top part of the rectangle is a dark blue section with a small white downward-pointing triangle on the left and the text "NaN" written in white font to the right of the triangle. Below this section is a larger black section with a dark blue rectangle within it containing two grey slanted lines, suggesting a loading or progress bar. To the right of the loading bar, there is the word "Test" written in white text.

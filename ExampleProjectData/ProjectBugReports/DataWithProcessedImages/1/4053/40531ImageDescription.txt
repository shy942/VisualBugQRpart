This image is a screenshot of a graphical user interface titled "Example: Custom rendering." The interface contains several sections and controls for rendering different graphical elements. At the top, there are three tabs labeled “Primitives,” “Canvas,” and “BG/FG draw lists,” with the “Primitives” tab selected. Below the tab section, there is a label “Gradients” next to a horizontal gradient bar ranging from black to white, green, yellow, and red.

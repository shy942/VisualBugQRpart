The image is a screenshot of a graphical user interface titled "Spline Editor." The editor window is bordered by a red title bar at the top that displays the title in white text. The main area of the window displays a dark grey background with a spline curve drawn on it. The spline starts from the lower left corner, rises to the top middle, dips down towards the bottom middle, and then rises sharply towards the top right corner. The curve has four control points, indicated by small white circles, that are connected by the curve. These control points can be adjusted to change the shape of the spline.

The image shows a section of a code editor with syntax highlighting. The background is dark, and the code is indented with various colors indicating different elements, common in many integrated development environments (IDEs). The line numbers are visible on the left side of the editor, ranging from 9017 to 9033. The function being defined appears to be `ImGui::ListBoxFooter` which takes no arguments (`void`). The code includes several comments in green, two occurrences of the function `GetParentWindow()`, and various ImGui-related elements such as `ImGuiWindow`, `ImRect`, and `ImGuiStyle`. Calls to methods like `EndChildFrame()`, `SameLine()`, `ItemSize()`, and `EndGroup()` are included. Some assignments and method calls are observed, and the overall structure appears to be part of a graphical user interface (GUI) framework.

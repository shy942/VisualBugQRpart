The image shows a section of C++ code that uses the Immediate Mode Graphical User Interface (ImGui) library. The code snippet appears to be setting up a window and using columns to layout internal UI components. The `Begin` function initializes a new ImGui window with the title "Test Window" and specific window flags such as `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoCollapse`, `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollbar`, and `ImGuiWindowFlags_ShowBorders`. The `Columns` function splits the window into two columns. The inner code block starts a child window titled "Test Child" with specific parameters for size and border attributes. It then includes a list box with a header labeled "Test Header" followed by a footer and ends the child window. The next column is then created for further UI components.

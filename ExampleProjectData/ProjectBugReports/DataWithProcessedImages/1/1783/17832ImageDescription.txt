The image displays a portion of C++ source code in a dark-themed integrated development environment (IDE). The code is located at line numbers 5046 to 5055. The function `ImGui::PopStyleVar` takes an integer parameter `count` and operates within a context object `g` of type `ImGuiContext`. The function uses a `while` loop that runs while `count` is greater than zero. Inside the loop, the last modifier from `g.StyleModifiers` is popped and stored in `backup`. The code then retrieves style variable information and checks the type of the variable. Depending on whether the type is `ImGuiDataType_Float`, `ImGuiDataType_Float2`, or `ImGuiDataType_Int`, it assigns the backed-up values accordingly. The `count` is decremented by one in each iteration of the loop.

This area displays a gradient transitioning horizontally from a bright yellow at the top to dark black at the bottom. Adjacent to the gradient is a vertical color bar displaying a spectrum of colors from red at the top to pink at the bottom. A small circle within the gradient indicates the currently selected color, a shade of greenish-yellow.

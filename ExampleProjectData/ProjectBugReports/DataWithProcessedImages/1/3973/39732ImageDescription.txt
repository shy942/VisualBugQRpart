This image displays a color picker interface. On the left side is a square gradient area where users can select the exact color shade they want. The top corresponds to brighter shades while the bottom is darker. Adjacent to this on the right is a vertical rainbow-colored gradient bar used for selecting the hue. Two color swatches labeled "Current" and "Original" are shown to the right of the gradient bar. The "Current" shows the currently selected color light green, and "Original" displays a red color. Below these color selection tools are six labeled rectangular boxes displaying the values for Red (R), Green (G), Blue (B), Alpha (A), Hue (H), Saturation (S), Value (V), and a box showing the hexadecimal code of the color with the value #BADA5500. A triangular shaped cursor is being used to select the hexadecimal value, indicated by a small white hand-shaped pointer.

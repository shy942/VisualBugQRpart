This image shows a screenshot of a computer interface divided into two sections. The background is light blue with a dark gray rectangular overlay in the middle, slightly towards the right. At the top section of the overlay, there are several repeating lines of white text: "Light removed", "Spotlight created", "Light removed", and "Spotlight created". At the bottom of the overlay, there is a black semi-opaque box over the dark gray section. Inside the black box, there are white numbers and words, possibly indicating some performance metrics or coordinates.

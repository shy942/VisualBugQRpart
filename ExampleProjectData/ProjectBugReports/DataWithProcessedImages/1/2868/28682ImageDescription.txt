 The image is a screenshot showing a side-by-side comparison of two versions of a computer program, likely shown in a code editor. The left side has highlighted code changes in orange, and the right side has highlighted code changes in yellow. The code involves vector normalization and scaling operations. Changes include alterations in the calculation and assignment of various variables related to `dm_x` and `dm_y`, as well as the introduction of new variables and functions such as `IM_FIXNORMAL2F` and `lunex_scale`.

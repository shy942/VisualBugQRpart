The image displays a terminal window on a Unix-like operating system. The prompt string shows the user is logged in as "nexus" on a machine also named "nexus," and they are currently in the "example_emscripten_wgpu" directory. The command being run is "em++ --check." The subsequent output includes an information line from the "emcc" command, indicating it is an Emscripten gcc/clang-like replacement and linker emulating GNU ld, version 2.0.31, with a specific build identifier in parentheses. This is followed by another line of information indicating that Emscripten is running sanity checks. Text in parentheses appears in green, differentiating it from the standard white text.

The image displays a terminal or command-line interface showing a list of git commit entries. Each commit includes a commit hash, author details, date, and a commit message. The entries are color-coded for easy distinction. The yellow-colored hashes represent the commit IDs, while other texts are white, with certain commit messages highlighted in different colors such as green and red.

Hello ocornut. I just read the changelog and found that the number of columns have been limited between `1-64`. Just wanted to know, Is there any other alternative for it? Are you planning to remove columns API from the future versions or something, what's the future plan?

 Since my file dialog uses a column-based design, as shown in the screenshot,instead of pure vertical list based (purely aesthetical I guess) It's entirely possible to exceed 64 columns depending on the amount of files and directories present in a specific folder and the size of the dialog itself. Thanks.

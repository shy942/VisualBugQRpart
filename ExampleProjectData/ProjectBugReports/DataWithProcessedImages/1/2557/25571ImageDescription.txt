The image displays a rectangular section of a digital screen with three adjacent labels and a color swatch. Each label exhibits an RGB color component value, representing the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color values respectively. The background of the image is a dark blue color, providing contrast against the white text inside each label. The first label shows "R: 115," the second shows "G: 200," and the third shows "B: 153." To the right of these labels, there is a color swatch filled with a color corresponding to the RGB values provided (a shade of green).

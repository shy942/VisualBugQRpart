The image shows a section of a user interface labeled "Map Hierarchy" in a collapsible panel, likely from a software application related to game development or 3D modeling. The panel has a dark background with light-colored text. At the top, there's a title bar that reads "Map Hierarchy" and a button with a downward-facing arrow, possibly for closing or minimizing the panel. Below the title bar is a hierarchical list of items. The first item is labeled "Game Objects in Scene" and has a collapsed sub-item labeled "Map A" indicated by a right-facing triangle icon next to it. The second item is a duplicate of the first, also labeled "Game Objects in Scene," and includes an identical collapsed sub-item labeled "Map A."

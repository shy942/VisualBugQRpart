The image shows part of a user interface with an icon of a blue and white spaceship or aircraft at the center. On top of the icon, there is a small menu or tooltip with white background and black text. The tooltip has two lines of text, each preceded by an arrow icon. The top line has a left-right double-headed arrow and says "New Horizontal divider", while the bottom line has an up-down double-headed arrow and says "New Vertical divider". The background of the image seems to have a grid with green guide lines, probably indicative of a design or editing tool.

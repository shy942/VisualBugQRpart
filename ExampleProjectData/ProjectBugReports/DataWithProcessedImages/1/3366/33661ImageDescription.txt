This image features a simple graphic representation of a heart rate monitor or electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing. The tracing is drawn in bright pink against a grey background. It starts as a straight horizontal line on the left, then spikes sharply upwards before descending again. After the spike, there's another brief horizontal segment, followed by a downward drop and a small upward rise before it levels out horizontally again on the right side of the image. The overall appearance mimics the visual of a heartbeat signal as displayed on medical monitoring equipment.

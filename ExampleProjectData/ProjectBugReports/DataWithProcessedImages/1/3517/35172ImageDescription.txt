The image shows a screenshot of a code snippet using the ImGui library, a graphical user interface (UI) framework commonly used in C++ applications. The code snippet includes a declaration of a static array of floats named `test` with three elements. This is followed by a function call to `ImGui::ColorEdit3`, which displays a color editor widget named "Color" corresponding to the `test` array values. Below this function, part of the application's UI is visible, displaying the `test` array's memory address and its current values.

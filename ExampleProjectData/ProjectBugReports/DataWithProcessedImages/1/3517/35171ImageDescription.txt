The image shows a color picker interface within a software application. The interface is primarily composed of a large square area displaying a gradient color selector, with red on the left side and various shades extending to black at the bottom. To the right of this square is a narrow vertical color slider, showing a rainbow-like gradient for selecting the hue. Above the gradient square, there is a text bar displaying RGB values: "R:255", "G:255", and "B:255", with corresponding numerical boxes filled in with the value 255. Near the top right, there is a small white square indicating the selected color. Just below the gradient square, there are sections labeled "Current" and "Original" with small white boxes next to them, likely showing the current color selection and the originally picked color, both currently white. Directly below these labels, there are the following RGB value displays again: "R:255", "G:255", "B:255". Underneath these, there are additional values indicating different color model values: "H:0", "S:0", and "V:255". Finally, at the bottom, there's a hex code input box containing the value "#FFFFFF". The overall background of the interface is dark, which highlights the color selection areas and text.

This image depicts a graphical user interface with a dark background, framed within a blue border. At the top, there is a blue bar containing the text “Hello, world!” with a small downward-pointing arrow next to it, suggesting it might be a collapsible header. Below that, there are options for "Disable all" and "Disable combo," each accompanied by checkboxes. The first "Disable all" checkbox is checked, causing the nested "Disable combo" checkbox beneath it to be enabled and also checked. Next to each "Disable combo" option, there is a drop-down menu shown with a default selection of "AAAA". A mouse cursor is over the second "Disable combo" label, indicating user interaction.

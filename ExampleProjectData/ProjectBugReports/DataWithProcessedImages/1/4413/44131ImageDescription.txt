The image depicts a screenshot of a file explorer within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), likely Visual Studio. The left panel shows a hierarchical view of the project's solution explorer with several files and directories expanded. The top level includes "References" and "External Dependencies." Under "External Dependencies," there are further folders named "gl3w," "glfw," and "ImGui," each containing a variety of files. The currently active file, "entrypoint.cpp," is highlighted in blue at the bottom of the list. The text is rendered in a monospaced font, consistent with coding and development environments.

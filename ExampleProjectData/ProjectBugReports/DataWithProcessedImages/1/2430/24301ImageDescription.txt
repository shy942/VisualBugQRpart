The image shows a screenshot of a Microsoft Visual Studio development environment with a project open. On the left side of the image, there is a Solution Explorer window displaying the directory structure of the project "example_freeglut_opengl2", which includes various folders such as "References" and "External Dependencies," as well as files like "imgui_demo.cpp" and "imgui_widgets.cpp." In the center of the screen, there is a main coding window open with a file named "imgui_impl_opengl2.cpp" loaded, with a portion of code visible. In the bottom right quadrant, overlapping the main coding area, there is an application in debug mode showing an interface of "Dear ImGui FreeGLUT + OpenGL2 Example," which includes a "Hello, world!" window with options and sliders. Additionally, a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library error dialog is present, displaying a debug error with options to "Abort," "Retry," or "Ignore." To the right, there is a "Diagnostic Tools" window showing performance profiling information like process memory and CPU usage.

I just started looking at ImGui for use with Freeglut, and I am sporadically getting crashes at startup on the (unmodified) provided example (i.e. it crashes often, but not always).

The crash, when it happens, seems to always happen in imgui.cpp : L3386

IM_ASSERT((g.IO.DeltaTime > 0.0f || g.FrameCount == 0)              && "Need a positive DeltaTime!");

disabling the assert everything seems to run fine

.

I am on:

- ToT master / 1.69
- Windows 10 / VS 2017
- freeglut 3.0.0

Other than that, the library seems awesome!

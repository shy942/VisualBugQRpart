This image is a screenshot of a terminal window displaying the output of compiling C++ code. The output shows multiple lines of commands and errors that indicate issues during the compilation process. Some lines show the g++ command used to compile .cpp files, along with various flags and options. The main error messages point to undeclared variables related to cursor types in GLFW, such as `GLFW_RESIZE_ALL_CURSOR`, `GLFW_RESIZE_NESW_CURSOR`, `GLFW_RESIZE_NWSE_CURSOR`, and `GLFW_NOT_ALLOWED_CURSOR`. For each error, a suggested alternative is provided, like `GLFW_HRESIZE_CURSOR` and `GLFW_VRESIZE_CURSOR`. The compilation errors are captured in different colors, with specific text highlighted in red for errors and cyan for suggestions. The final line shows a `make` error indicating that the compilation failed.

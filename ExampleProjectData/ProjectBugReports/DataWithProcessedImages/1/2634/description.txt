I would like to ask, if it has a sense to add a possiblity to not render a collapse button in a title bar, while still allowing to collapse a window by double-click on title bar. 
From my perspective, the interface that I'm designing would be cleaner without the button (see the screenshot)

The simplest way would be to add an additional flag to `ImGuiWindowFlags_`, however, most of the bits are already used. The other approach would be to extend the `ImGuiStyle` struct by an additional field.

What do you think about the idea? If you agree, I could prepare PR.

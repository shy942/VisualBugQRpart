The image depicts a digital readout interface for a spindle, presented on a black background. At the top of the interface, there is a title bar labeled "Spindle" with a small triangular indicator on the left and an 'X' symbol on the right, likely for closing the interface. Below the title, there is a horizontally aligned blue rectangle with a value of '0' inside it. Centrally located in large white text is the spindle's speed displayed as "1 RPM." Directly beneath this speed readout is a red rectangle containing the text "N/A." Towards the bottom section of the interface, there are three small text entries:  - "current 0.52 A," - "voltage 112.70 V,"  - "cos Î¸ 0.72." These entries detail the spindle's current, voltage, and the cosine of the phase angle respectively.

The image features a user interface (UI) element that appears to be a status display for a spindle. At the top of the interface, there is a title label "Spindle." Below the title, in a dark blue box, the number "0" is displayed. Underneath this, in larger font, the text "1 RPM" is shown, indicating revolutions per minute. Further down, in a dark red box, "N/A" is written. At the bottom section of the interface, there are three lines of text providing additional details. The first line reads "current," followed by the value "0.52 A." The second line states "voltage" with the value "112.70 V," and the third line shows "cos Î¸" with the value "0.72." The entire interface has a dark background with light-colored text.

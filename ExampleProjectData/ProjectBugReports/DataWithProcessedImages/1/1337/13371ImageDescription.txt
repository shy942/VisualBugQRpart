The image shows a software interface titled "Batch view" positioned at the top left corner of the window. There are two text input fields labeled "command filter" and "field filter" arranged horizontally across the top part of the screen, alongside a button labeled "Collapse columns." Below these elements, the interface displays several sections of hexadecimal data and corresponding details highlighted in alternating shades of gray and blue. Each section appears to be expandable, indicated by downward-pointing arrows. The sections outlined are labeled with codes such as "0x00020004: MI_LOAD_REGISTER_IMM," "0x00020010: 3DSTATE_AA_LINE_PARAMETERS," and "0x0002001c: 3DSTATE_DRAWING_RECTANGLE," followed by various hexadecimal addresses, lengths, and parameter data.

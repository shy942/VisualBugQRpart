Hi,

I'm trying to layout a window so that there is a top part that doesn't scroll, and the bottom part is a list that can be scrolled :

This can be implemented by using BeginChild()/BeginChildFrame() for the scrolling part.
The slightly annoying problem with this is that previously the entire window would be reactive to click-and-drag (so you can move it by clicking anywhere), but now only the part outside of BeginChild/EndChild has that ability.

Is there a way around this?

Thanks!

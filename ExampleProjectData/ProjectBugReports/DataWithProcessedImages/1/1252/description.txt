I just came to the realization that there's no reason to prevent most popups from being moved.
In `BeginPopupEx` if we just remove the `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoMove` flag, popups can be moved.

Does anyone sees in their codebase, a side-effect, potential breakage or reason to not just remove this flag?

Thinking of cases such as:

The popup auto position but no reason to lock its position.

When the popup is filled with menu items and auto-sized there's typically little room to grab and move them, but I don't think it is something that people would really care about. Also, because child menu are positioned by their parent, you still cannot move a child menu (which also is to be expected).

The image shows a section of a computer screen with two collapsed dropdown menus labeled "FPS Graph" and "File Access." Both menus have a dark, translucent background and light grey text. Above these menus, a traditional menu bar is evident, featuring menu options "File," "Map," "Windows," and "Help." The FPS graph dropdown displays "60.00 FPS," while the file access section displays four greyed-out segments along with metrics for reads, writes, accesses, and total, each currently showing "0.00." The background is entirely black, highlighting the menus prominently.

The image is a screenshot displaying a user interface with a table containing two columns labeled "Value" and "Label." Each row in the "Value" column contains different types of input fields and corresponding data, while each row in the "Label" column contains a label describing the type of input in the "Value" column. Specifically, the table includes a combo box displaying "AAAA," a text input field with "Hello, world!," an integer input showing "123," a float input showing "0.001," a double input showing "999999.0000001," and a scientific input showing "1.000000e+10." Each input field in the "Value" column has associated increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons denoted with "-" and "+" signs, respectively.

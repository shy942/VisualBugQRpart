ImGui Version: v1.61
Backend: DirectX11 sample (as well as our own DirectX12)

It seems if I create a popup (modal or otherwise) I cannot use a combo box in the popup.  Clicking the down arrow on the combo box flickers for a frame and then disappears.  This works just fine with a regular window.

Thanks so much for writing ImGui by the way!  It's great!  I'm going to get our company to send you a donation here soon, as looks like we will be using ImGui more and more.

Cheers,

```
ImGui::OpenPopup("BrokenComboBoxes");
if (ImGui::BeginPopupModal("BrokenComboBoxes", nullptr, 0)) {
	static int loggingLevel = 0;
	static const char* logLevels[] = {
		"Trace",
		"Debug",
		"Info",
		"Warn",
		"Error",
		"Critical"
	};
	ImGui::Combo("Logging Level", &loggingLevel, logLevels, IM_ARRAYSIZE(logLevels));
}
ImGui::EndPopup();
```

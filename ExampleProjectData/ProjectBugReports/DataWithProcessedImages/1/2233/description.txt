For some reason i am unable to print lithuanian characters (?????š??) with ImGui. At first i thought it is something with my code, but even if i run official demo i see this:

No matter what i try - always get question marks in place of mentioned characters.

Tested official imgui samples: win32 dx12, linux sdl2 opengl2, linux sdl2 opengl2, linux glfw_opengl2.
Tested 1.66b release and latest snapshot of docking branch.

In my own application i tested printing text with `ImGui::TextColored` by passing it utf-8-encoded string. I even tried with `u8"?????"` literal.

I tested default font as well as google's noto fonts. I inspected my used fonts in font preview only to see that characters i am looking for indeed are supported. I do not specify any font ranges for noto fonts to include all characters.

I see no white squares as mentioned in font readme so texture must properly fit fonts. At this point i am still not sure if this is my error or the issue. Is demo supposed to show proper text instead of ????? there?

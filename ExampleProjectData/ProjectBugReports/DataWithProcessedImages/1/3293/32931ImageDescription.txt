This image features a portion of a software interface displaying various commands related to a GPS system, specifically the G1000 unit, which is commonly used in aviation. The commands are listed in a directory-like format, with each command prefixed by "sim/GPS/g1000n1_". Beside each command, the letter "C" indicates the type or status of the command. To the right of each entry are buttons labeled with either "Once" or "Hold," which likely represent different modes of execution for each command. A mouse cursor is visibly pointed at the command "sim/GPS/g1000n1_direct."

ExampleProjectData/ProjectBugReports/ contains information about bug reports (title, description, and extracted multimedia information). In particular, this folder contains another folder named DataWithProcessedImages, which includes project folders 1, 2, and so on. Under each project (e.g., 1), there are bug report folders, where the folder names represent the bug IDs. Each bug report folder contains the following information:
	title.txt - The title of the bug report.
	description.txt - The description of the bug report.
	imageURL.txt - The image URLs are attached to the bug reports. There might be one or more images. 
	BugIDNo.png - It is the image file itself. For example, for a bug report (id =1213) that contains only one attached image, the name of the image will be 12131.png.
	BugIDNoImageContent.txt—This file contains the extracted multimedia information using GPT-4o tools. For example, the file name for the above example will be 12131ImageContent.txt. We use the content of these files in this research. 
	BUgIDNoImageDescription.txt - This file contains a description of the attached image/s provided by the GPT-4o tool. For example, the file for the above example will be 12131ImageDescription.txt. We have yet to utilize this type of information in our research.

ExampleProjectData/SourceCodes/ contains the codebases for our projects. For example, inside the SourceCodes folder, the source code for our first project is shown as Project1. 

ExampleProjectData/ProjectIndexes/ contains Lucene index.

ExampleProjectData/ConstructedQueries/ contains constructed queries.

QR-Part/ConstructedQueries-QR/ contains constructed queries for QR queries. Please, save your reformulated queries in here.

ExampleProjectData/SearchResults/ contains lucene seach resutls.

QR-Part/SearchResults-QR/ contains lucene result for QR queries.

ExampleProjectData/EvaluationResults contains the details results for each project.

QR-Part/EvaluationResults-QR contains the details redults for each project for QR queries.

ExampleProjectData/OrganizedData contains overall result for all bug reports. 

QR-Part/OrganizedData-QR contains overall results of all bug report QR queries.

BugIDs folder contains the information about bug reports which belong to which category. They are as follows:
	BugIDSFinal.txt - it contains IDs of all bug reports that are eligible for our experiments. The format is ProjectID-BugID. For example, 351-627  means the project is 351 and the bug report id is 627.
	UItext.txt - Bug report IDs that belong to UI with text category.
	PC.txt - Bug Report IDs that belong to the programming code category.
	Excp.txt - Exceptions and errors category.
	Git.txt - Git commands.
	Python.txt - Python commands.
	OtherCommand.txt - Other commands.	
	English.txt - English texts.
	NotEnglish.txt - Other language texts.

GroundTruths contains ground truth file information (i.e., gold set). For example, ground truth file for our first project name is groundtruth_1.txt. Here, the format is as follows: 
		BugID NoOfSourCodeFiles
		File1
		File2
		….
CKeys contains all files’ key information.

corpus_class folder contains source code files without preprocessing. 

Corpus_class_python contains the pre-processed version of the source codes.

Please, reformulate queries and save them in QR-Part/ConstructedQueries-QR/1_no_stem/ for Project1. The format should be bugID_extended_query. 
You will find UI bug IDs in the folder "/BugIDs/UItext.txt"

First, construct two types of content for each bug report -
  i) title and description (i.e., T+D), and 
  ii) title, description, and image content (i.e., T+D+I). 

Second, we reformulate both contents using the BLIZZARD [26] tool and combine them.
